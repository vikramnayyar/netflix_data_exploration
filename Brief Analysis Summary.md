## 1. Content Strategy Based on Type and Talent
* Movies outnumber TV Shows more than 2:1.
* Top directors and cast tend to specialize—directors with 9+ movies or at least 1 TV Show perform better.
* Successful TV Show casts have worked in both formats; successful movie casts mostly focus on movies.
* Netflix should prioritize talent based on these performance patterns for better ROI.

## 2. Geographic Trends and Production Focus
* USA dominates both movies and TV Shows, followed by India (movies) and UK (TV Shows).
* Countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan produce more TV Shows than movies.
* Selective additions from countries outside top-4 producers can increase variety and maintain quality.

## 3. Genre Preferences and Viewer Behavior
* For Movies: Comedy, Drama, and International genres consistently dominate all time periods.
* For TV Shows: International TV, TV Dramas, and TV Comedies are top picks.
* Netflix should focus on producing or acquiring content in these genres while being selective in niche genres.

## 4. Content Duration Preferences
* 80% of movies are around 2 hours – this is the preferred length.
* 70% of TV Shows have only 1 season – audiences lean toward short series.
* Netflix should prioritize content that aligns with these duration patterns.

## 5. Temporal Trends and Strategic Additions
* Major surge in content additions from 2015 to 2020, with peaks in 2019–2020.
* Addition spikes occur every 3–4 weeks, boosting user engagement.
* Content release patterns adjust during crises (e.g., COVID), suggesting Netflix can preemptively add content to hedge disruptions.

## 6. Age of Content at Addition
* Recent additions tend to include newer content (within 1–3 years of release), especially post-2012.
* Older content added tends to be well over 10 years old, indicating two clear user interest zones: fresh content and nostalgic classics.
